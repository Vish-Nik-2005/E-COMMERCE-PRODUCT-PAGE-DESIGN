#DESCRIPTION: My domain is UI/UX design, and I worked on an E-Commerce Product Page Design using Figma. The task involved creating a visually appealing and user-friendly product page layout that showcased product details, images, pricing, and purchasing options. I utilized design principles like visual hierarchy, consistent typography, and intuitive navigation to enhance the user experience. Interactive components such as add-to-cart buttons, image carousels, and rating systems were incorporated to make the page dynamic and engaging. This project helped me understand the importance of balancing aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that the design not only looked appealing but also guided users toward their purchasing decisions. Collaborating in Figma allowed for real-time feedback and version control, making the design process efficient and adaptable to future improvements.
